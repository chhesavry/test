To create a Flask application that automatically fetches updated files from your GitHub repository whenever it runs, you can set up the application to check for updates and pull the latest versions of the files. Here’s how to do that step-by-step:

Step 1: Clone Your Repository
If you haven't already done so, clone your GitHub repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/chhesavry/test.git
cd test
Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Flask and GitPython installed. GitPython will help manage the Git repository.

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask GitPython
Step 4: Update app.py
Replace the content of app.py with the following code. This code will update the local repository from GitHub each time the app runs:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory
import os
import git

app = Flask(__name__)

# Local repository path
REPO_PATH = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'test')

def update_repo():
    try:
        if os.path.exists(REPO_PATH):
            print("Updating repository...")
            repo = git.Repo(REPO_PATH)
            repo.remotes.origin.pull()  # Pull latest changes from GitHub
            print("Repository updated.")
        else:
            print("Repository not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error updating repository: {str(e)}")

# Update the repository on startup
update_repo()

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return send_from_directory(REPO_PATH, 'index.html')

@app.route('/<path:filename>')
def static_files(filename):
    return send_from_directory(REPO_PATH, filename)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Step 5: Run the Application
Ensure you're in the test directory where app.py is located.
Run the Flask app:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Step 6: Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Explanation
GitPython: This library allows you to interact with Git repositories. When the app starts, it checks if the repository exists and pulls the latest changes from the origin remote (your GitHub repository).
Serving Files: The Flask app serves the index.html and any other static files directly from the local repository directory.
Important Considerations
Authentication: If your repository is private, you’ll need to handle authentication (e.g., SSH keys or GitHub tokens).
File Conflicts: If you modify files locally and then run the app, Git might encounter conflicts when trying to pull updates. You might need to handle such cases depending on your use case.
Permissions: Ensure your application has the necessary permissions to access the local directory and perform Git operations.
If You Encounter Issues
Errors in Updating: If there are errors related to Git, check your Git setup or any authentication issues.
Missing Files: Ensure that all necessary files (like index.html, style.css, script.js) are in your Git repository.
If you need further assistance or have specific errors, feel free to share!

The error you’re encountering is due to PowerShell’s execution policy, which restricts the running of scripts for security reasons. You can resolve this issue by changing the execution policy to allow script execution.

Steps to Enable Script Execution in PowerShell
Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Right-click on the Start menu and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Windows Terminal (Admin)".
Check the Current Execution Policy: You can check your current policy by running:

powershell
Copy code
Get-ExecutionPolicy
Change the Execution Policy: To allow script execution, you can set the execution policy to RemoteSigned or Unrestricted. Run the following command:

powershell
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
or

powershell
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
You may be prompted to confirm the change; type Y and press Enter.

Close the Administrator PowerShell: After changing the policy, close the PowerShell window.

Open a New PowerShell Window: Open a regular PowerShell window (not as administrator) and navigate back to your project directory:

powershell
Copy code
cd C:\Users\Yato\Desktop\test
Activate the Virtual Environment: Now, try activating your virtual environment again:

powershell
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
Continue with the Setup
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can proceed with the rest of the setup as described in the previous steps, including installing Flask and GitPython.

If you have any other questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!

Great! It looks like your virtual environment is now activated successfully. You can now proceed with the following steps to set up your Flask application:

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
With your virtual environment activated, run the following command to install Flask and GitPython:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask GitPython
Step 2: Update app.py
Ensure your app.py file has the following code to automatically pull the latest files from your GitHub repository:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory
import os
import git

app = Flask(__name__)

# Local repository path
REPO_PATH = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'test')

def update_repo():
    try:
        if os.path.exists(REPO_PATH):
            print("Updating repository...")
            repo = git.Repo(REPO_PATH)
            repo.remotes.origin.pull()  # Pull latest changes from GitHub
            print("Repository updated.")
        else:
            print("Repository not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error updating repository: {str(e)}")

# Update the repository on startup
update_repo()

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return send_from_directory(REPO_PATH, 'index.html')

@app.route('/<path:filename>')
def static_files(filename):
    return send_from_directory(REPO_PATH, filename)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Step 3: Run the Application
Now that your code is set up:

Ensure you are in the project directory where app.py is located.
Run the Flask app:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Step 4: Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Important Notes
Git Repository: Ensure that your local repository is correctly cloned and contains all necessary files (like index.html, style.css, script.js).
Updates: The application will pull the latest updates from your GitHub repository every time it starts. If you make changes to your files in the GitHub repository, they will be reflected when you restart the Flask app.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors, check the console output for messages related to Git operations.
If you have issues with file paths, make sure the REPO_PATH points to the correct directory.
If you have any further questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!
